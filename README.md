##  Overview

The **DroneOps Back-End** manages core drone operations such as telemetry data, repairs, inventory, and user authentication.  
It provides a RESTful API that can be easily connected to a front-end or mobile application for full-stack drone management.

---

##  Features

-  **User Authentication and Authorization**  
  Registration, login, and token-based authentication (JWT).

-  **Drone Management**  
  CRUD operations for drones, including model, serial number, and operational status.

-  **Telemetry and Events**  
  Record and monitor drone activity, events, and alerts.

-  **Repairs and Maintenance**  
  Track parts replaced, actions taken, and maintenance history.

-  **Inventory Control**  
  Manage spare parts, replacements, and component stock.

-  **Scalable Architecture**  
  Modular structure with controllers, routes, and middlewares.

-  **Validation and Error Handling**  
  Centralized input validation and standardized error responses.

- **Git**

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AngelScarpetta2004/back-end-droneops.git
   cd back-end-droneops
   
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
    npm install
   
3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a .env file in the project root and include:
   PORT=8000
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/droneops
  JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

## Running the Server

  For development:
    
    npm run dev
    
  For production:
      
    npm start

| POST | `/api/drones` | Create a new drone |
| GET | `/api/drones/:id` | Get drone by ID |
| PUT | `/api/drones/:id` | Update drone info |
| DELETE | `/api/drones/:id` | Delete drone |

---

###  Repairs

## Data Models (Example)
### User
  {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    password: String (hashed),
    role: String // admin, operator
  }

### Drone
  {
    model: String,
    serialNumber: String,
    status: String,
    purchaseDate: Date
  }

### Repair
  {
    droneId: ObjectId,
    description: String,
    dateReported: Date,
    dateResolved: Date,
    cost: Number,
    partsUsed: [String]
  }

### Event
  {
    droneId: ObjectId,
    eventType: String,
    timestamp: Date,
    description: String
  }

## Authentication

### JWT-based authentication

Tokens are issued upon login and must be included in request headers:

Authorization: Bearer <token>


Middleware validates token and grants access to protected routes.

## Testing

If you have tests configured, run them with:

    npm test


You can use frameworks like Mocha, Chai, or SuperTest to test routes and database interactions.
